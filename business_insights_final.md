# 📉 Business Performance Analysis & Recommendations

## 1. Overall Feedback on Current Trend
**Status: Declining (Concern)**
The data indicates a **downward trend** in sales over the analyzed period (April 2022 to June 2022).
-   **April Sales:** Peak performance (~28.8M)
-   **May Sales:** Slight dip (~26.2M)
-   **June Sales:** Further decline (~23.4M)

While the business is generating significant revenue, the consistent month-over-month drop suggests we are moving out of a peak season or facing retention issues.

## 2. Reasons Explaining the Trend

### 🔻 Why is the trend dropping?
1.  **Post-Season Slump:** The high sales in April likely correspond to a festive or seasonal peak (e.g., Summer sale start). The subsequent drop is a natural correction but needs management.
2.  **High Cancellation Rate (~13%):** A significant portion of orders are marked as **"Cancelled"**. This is a major revenue leak. If 13% of orders fail, you are losing potential revenue despite paying for customer acquisition.
3.  **Fulfillment Delays:** A large chunk of orders are "Shipped" but not yet "Delivered". Long delivery times often lead to customer cancellations or returns.
4.  **Product Concentration:** Revenue is heavily dependent on a few categories (Sets, Kurtas). If demand for these drops, the entire business suffers.

## 3. Specific Suggestions for Improvement

### ✅ Actionable Steps to Improve Performance

**A. Reduce Cancellations (Immediate Impact)**
-   **Improve Descriptions:** Ensure product images and size charts are 100% accurate. Returns/Cancellations often happen due to "Expectation vs Reality" mismatch.
-   **Faster Dispatch:** Prioritize "Fulfilled by Amazon" (FBA) over Merchant fulfillment where possible, as FBA has lower cancellation rates.

**B. Stabilize Revenue (Growth Strategy)**
-   **Flash Sales in Low Months:** Run targeted promotions in **June/July** to counter the seasonal dip.
-   **Bundling:** Create "Summer Sets" or bundles to increase Average Order Value (AOV) even if order count drops.

**C. Regional Optimization**
-   **Target Top States:** Data shows specific states (likely Maharashtra, Karnataka) drive mostly sales. Focus 80% of ad spend there.
-   **Fix Low-Performing Areas:** Identify regions with high returns and consider temporarily stopping COD (Cash on Delivery) there.

**D. Inventory Planning**
-   **Stock Up for April/May:** Based on this year's trend, ensure inventory is highest in March to prepare for the April peak.
-   **Clearance in June:** Use the declining months to clear out slow-moving stock at a discount to free up cash flow.
